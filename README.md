A very basic minecraft clone written in Kotlin. A refactor of my old VoxelGame1, which was written in c++.

Uses lwjgl's openGL bindings for the graphics. Currently implements procedural generation with 32^3 chunks, placing + breaking blocks with naive raycasting, player movement, and multiplayer with sockets.
